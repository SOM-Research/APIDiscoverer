# APIDiscoverer
APIDiscoverer generates an OpenAPI description by examining and analyzing a sample of requests/responses sent/received by a user when interacting with a REST Web API. The tool is implemented as a Web application which provides a user-friendly interface offering a form to invoke a REST Web API and download the discovered OpenAPI description.

## Using the tool

The tool is available at [http://som-research.uoc.edu/tools/APIDiscoverer](http://som-research.uoc.edu/tools/APIDiscoverer).
You can also downlaod the file [apidiscoverer.war](https://github.com/SOM-Research/APIDiscoverer/raw/master/apidiscoverer/apidiscoverer.war "apidiscoverer.war) and deploy it in a servlet container such as [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/ "Apache Tomcat).


## What is comming next?

We  are expanding the approach to improve the discovery process and to cover other aspects  such as security.
If you have any recommendation, just contact us.
